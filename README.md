# PyXRFPower

PyXRFPower is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to allow one to quickly estimate element-dependent spatial resolutions of scanning fluorescence X-ray microscopy (SFXM) images acquired at synchrotron light source beamlines via power spectral density (PSD) analysis [1].

# Features

- Tunable number of radial frequency bins
Isotropic and anisotropic (i.e. $`E = mc^{2}`$ spatial resolutions)

# Installation

1. [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) must be installed for the GUI to function.
2. Clone this repository
